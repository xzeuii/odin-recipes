    This project is a basic HTML website, self taught using online courses.
    Once I complete I hope this project will show basic knowledge in HTML 
    and how to build a very basic website.
    
    Upon finishing this project, I feel I've learned more and demonstrated
    my ability to code basic websites and webpages using HTML, and to post 
    those changes to a GitHub repo via Git.
